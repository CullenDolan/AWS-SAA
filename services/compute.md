# Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)

## Instance Types
- Genereal Purpose (t, m, A, Mac): balance of compute and networking. Best for basic use cases such as web servers. These are busrtable meaning they sit at a baseline of CPU utilization and accrue credits to burst higher when they are under the limit. If they burst and use up all credits, they will drop back to a minimum threshold. Credits will erase if instance is paused
